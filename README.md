#### 1. Download the workshop materials.  

Click on the green button labelled "Code" near the top of the screen. Select "Download ZIP". Once downloaded, unzip these files and save them to a new folder on your computer that is easy to find.

#### 2. Install R  

If you are using Windows, use [this .exe file](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/release.htm) to download and install the software.  

If you are using a Mac, go to [this page](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html), and select the link associated with the location nearest to you. From there, follow the link to the Mac download and select the most up-to-date version to access the files you will need to download and install the software.  

*If you already have R installed on your computer, please ensure that it is at least version 4.0*

#### 3. Install RStudio  

Install the free RStudio IDE from [this website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download) by selecting the version appropriate for your operating system (Windows or Mac).  

*If you already have RStudio installed on your computer, please ensure that it is at least version 1.4*

**Note: If you have separate user and admin accounts, you should run the installers as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later.**

#### 4. Install Packages  

Install the up-to-date versions of each required package, using the following code:  

`install.packages(dplyr)`
`install.packages(lubridate)`
