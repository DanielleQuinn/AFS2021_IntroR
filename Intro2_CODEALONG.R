# ---- {tidyverse} ----
# The {tidyverse} is a collection of packages that share an
# underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures and
# work with "tidy data", which follows specific rules and best practices

# {dplyr}: data manipulation
# {lubridate}: working with dates and times
# {ggplot2}: visualizing data
# {tidyr}: tidying data
# {broom}: tidying output from models
# {stringr}: working with strings
# {forcats}: working with factors
# {purrr}: functional programming
# {rvest}: web scraping

# ---- Subsetting Data with {dplyr} ----
# select() : selects columns from a data frame and outputs as a data frame
# Goal: Output the column called year

# Goal: Output the columns called park_name and state

# Goal: Convert the data frame to a tibble for easier viewing

# A tibble is essentially the same as a data frame, with some extra features
# Today, primarily just the way the output is shown; more user friendly


## Goal: Output the columns called park_name, latitude, and longitude from
## (a) the parks data frame

## (b) the parks_tb tibble


# filter() : filters rows from a data frame
# Goal: Output the rows that correspond to parks established prior to 1910


# Goal: Output the rows that correspond to parks from California (CA)


## What is the output from the following line of code?
filter(parks_tb,
       year %in% 1950:1980,
       acres > 50000)

## Output the rows that correspond to parks established in the
## first six months of any year, in Florida (FL)


# ---- Creating Workflows ----
# Information is put into a "pipe"
# It comes out the other side and is used
# as the first argument for the function that awaits

###
# 'Typical' pipe: %>% from {tidyverse}
# Brand new pipe (May 18, 2021): |> from {base}
###

# Goal: Find the square root of 81

# Goal: Output the column called year

# Pipes are valuable when we want to perform multiple steps

# Goal: Find the square root of the absolute value of -16
# Nesting functions:

# Using pipes:

# Goal: Considering only parks established prior to 1910,
# ouput the columns called year, park_name, and state

## Can you explain why this gives the same output?
parks_tb %>%
  select(year, park_name, state) %>%
  filter(year < 1910)

## What would happen if you tried to run this?
parks_tb %>%
  select(park_name, state) %>%
  filter(year < 1910)

## Choose any state. Output the park name, cost of an annual pass,
## and latitude and longitude of parks in that state

## Output park_code and acres columns from parks in that state
## that are at least 70000 acres in area

# ---- Modifying Data with {dplyr} ----
# mutate() : creates a column or modifies an existing column

# Use case #1: Creating a new column

# Goal: Create a new column called user that contains your name

# Use case #2: Creating a new column based on calculations from an existing column

# Goal: Convert acres to square kilometers (divide acres by 247)

## Goal: Create column of park age

# Use case #3: Creating a new column based on logic statements about an existing column

# Goal: Create a column that describes if the park is free (TRUE) or paid (FALSE)

## Goal: Create a column that is "Old" if the park is more than
## 50 years old and "New" if it is not

# ---- Summarising Data with {dplyr} ----
# summarise() : returns a single value based on the instructions you give it
# Goal: Find the maximum entrance fee (per_person)

## Goal: Find the minimum year a park was established

# group_by() : splits your data into groups based on the variables you specify
# Goal: Group by state

# Goal: Use group_by() and summarise() together to find the
# total area (acres) of parks, by state

# This can be stored as a data frame object

# The column names can be specified in summarise

# Goal: What is the average park size and average entrance
# fee (per_person), by state?

## Goal: What is the first year and most recent year that
## a park was established in each state?

# n() : counts occurences in each group using summarise()
## Remember here that each record represents exactly one park
## and each park is represented by exactly one row

# Goal: How many parks in each state?

# Goal: How many parks in each state, by age_class?

## Goal: How many new parks were established each year?

# n_distinct() : counts unique occurences of a variable in each group using summarise()

# Goal: How many different states had new parks established each year?

# ---- Dealing with dates and times with {lubridate} ----
# Goal: Split the date column into year, month, and day columns

# ymd() : takes a string representing year-month-day and converts it to a date
test_value <- "1999-11-21"
test_value
class(test_value)

test_date <- ymd(test_value)
test_date
class(test_date)

## How are year, month, and day stored in our data?

# How do we convert it to "yyyy-mm-dd" format so we can apply ymd()?

# Goal: Paste year, month, and day together and
# pass it to the ymd() function to format it as a date

# ---- Capstone ----
# Choose five states.
# Generate a table using a {dplyr} workflow that describes, for each state:
# (a) the number of parks
# (b) the smallest area
# (c) the last time a new park was established
# (d) the average entrance fee (per person)
# (e) extra challenge: how many free parks it has
##### hint: think about characteristics of data classes
